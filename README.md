This demo was inspired by Milan Janosov. His LinkedIn is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-janosov/)

I wanted to create my own timelapse of Satellite images using [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/).

Ill continue to build out this codebase in my leisure time. Oh the places we will go!

See Milan's blog here, it was the basis of this demo: https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-satellite-image-timelapses-2b479f86ff52
