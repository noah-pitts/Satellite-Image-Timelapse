My wife issued me a challenge.

"Map a random place in the world of something _geospatial_"

She can see how passionate im getting about my work these days, and wanted me to have another outlet to explore this new passion ðŸ’š

To complete this challenge, I decided to follow my inspration.

I saw a post by Milan Janosov. His LinkedIn is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-janosov/)

In his post, he created a timelapse of Satellite images using the new [ESA Sentinel Hub API](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/develop/api/)

I wanted to create my own timelapse of Satellite images using [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/).

Ill continue to build out this codebase in my leisure time. Oh the places we will go!

See Milan's blog here, it was the basis of this demo: https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-satellite-image-timelapses-2b479f86ff52

Thanks Milan!
